# Currency Converter JavaFX

This is a simple currency converter application for demonstrating Java FX. The application was initially created in IntelliJ using SDK 20 before the SDK was updated to 21 to match the version used by the Gluon SceneBuilder application.
There is a duplicate repository that contains a Java Swing version of the same application for comparison.
